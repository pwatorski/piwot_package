# Welcome to Piwot Package.

This is my personal package containing multiple, often unrelated features facilitating work with Python3 and its many little annoyances.

As for now the package contains functionalities relating to:
- I/O (i.e. complex dir listing, simple txt and json i/o functions)
- Timestamps
